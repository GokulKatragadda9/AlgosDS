Brushing up on Algorithms and Data Structures...

One fine day, I decided to build up my github profile. So, I thought I would brush up on my algorithms and data structures which would also help me prepare for the interviews.

I read Cracking the Coding Interview book and started solving the problems in it using my favorite language Swift. I tried to add the Time and Space complexities as well for each problem.
If you are wondering why there is no commit history, Well, I was lazy and I used my Playgrounds to solve the problems which was synced to my iCloud.
I will keep adding to this repo whenever I solve some leetcode.


Some of the topics that are covered are:

  - Arrays
  - LinkedLists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Recursion
  - Dynamic Programming 
  - OO Design
